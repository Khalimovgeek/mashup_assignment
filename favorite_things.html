    <h1>My Favorite Things</h1>

    <h3>My Hobbies and Intrests</h3>
    <p>I enjoy staying active and curious in my free time.
         Cycling is one of my favorite hobbies because it helps me clear my mind 
         while staying fit, and I like the sense of freedom that comes with long rides. 
         Gaming is another interest of mine—it’s a fun way to relax, challenge myself, 
         and sometimes connect with friends.
    </p>
    <p>I also really enjoy quieter activities like reading and listening to music. 
        Reading helps me learn new things and escape into different worlds, 
        while music is something I turn to every day to match my mood,
         whether I need motivation or just want to unwind.</p>
